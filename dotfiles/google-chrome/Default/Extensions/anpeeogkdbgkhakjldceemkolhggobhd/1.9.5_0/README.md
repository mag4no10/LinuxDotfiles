**Quick identification of Amazon products with shipping restrictions**

Have you ever spend hours looking for items on Amazon sites but none of them were available for shipping to your location? With this **browser extension** you will be able to detect these items quickly from the results page, so you can easily identify which products are eligible for you.

## Features

- Identify the non-eligible items (within the results page) because of shipping restrictions.
- Add a badge for each item (within the results page) which is only available through other sellers.
- It works with any Amazon site regardless of the language you use or the country you live in.

### Developer mode

#### Google Chrome

- [Download](https://github.com/sdelquin/sendhereplz/archive/master.zip) the project.
- Uncompress the `.zip` file (a folder named `sendhereplz-master` is created).
- Place the folder where you want to keep it (write down this location).
- Open [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/es_es/chrome/) browser.
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` on navigation bar.
- Check the box for **Developer Mode** in the top right.
- Click on **Load unpacked**.
- Select the folder from the location where the extension was saved.

#### Mozilla Firefox

- [Download](https://github.com/sdelquin/sendhereplz/archive/master.zip) the project.
- Uncompress the `.zip` file (a folder named `sendhereplz-master` is created).
- Place the folder where you want to keep it (write down this location).

Note that:

- First item has a new badge below to indicate that it is only available from other sellers.
- Second item is shaded and it has a new icon since Amazon does not ship it to your location.
- Third item is kept as usual because it is fully eligible (in terms of shipping).

## Hide unshippable items

We think that hiding unshippable items would be too intrusive for the final user. There is a way you can achieve this though:

- Install uBlock Origin extension (available for multiple browsers).
- Add the following code to "My filters" panel:
  ```
  amazon.com##div[class*="shp-not-deliverable-product"]
  ```
  Just replace `.com` with the extension of Amazon you're using.
